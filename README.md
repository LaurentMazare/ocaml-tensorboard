# ocaml-tensorboard

The [TensorBoard project](https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/)
is made of various web applications to help understanding TensorFlow based models.

The __ocaml-tensorboard__ library provides functions to write TensorBoard
events from ocaml without relying on TensorFlow.

Part of the code comes from [ocaml-protoc](https://github.com/mransan/ocaml-protoc),
[ppx_deriving_protobuf](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving_protobuf).
